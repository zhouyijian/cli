// to its stderr envelope, and writing to it does not change what the user
// sees. Read it with errs.ProblemOf and check the boolean — two exit-code-only
// signals carry no Problem and write no envelope, because their result is
// already on stdout: a partial failure, and a bare predicate exit.
//
// Some failures end the process before this event can be emitted, so a
// handler must not be relied on as an exhaustive audit trail: bootstrap
// rejections, a plugin whose own installation or Startup handler failed, and
// shell-completion invocations all exit without a Shutdown event.
